## Contents

### `src`

* `bn_generic.jazz`: part of the `libjbn` library.
* `ring_ops.jazz` Ring operations
   - `bn_breduce` Barrett reduction;
   - `mulm` multiplication (uses `bn_breduce`);
   - `expm` Montgomery ladder based exponentiation (uses `mulm`).
   

### `proof`
* `eclib/` parts of Jasmin stdlib (including autogenerated Array* WArray*).
* `montgomery_ladder/` abstract and axiomatized formalization of correctness of montgomery ladder algorithm.
* `BarrettRedInt.ec` Analysis (correctness + width) of Barrett reduction on integers and reals.
* `Ring_ops_extract.ec` EasCrypt extract from `ring_ops.jazz`
* `Ring_ops_proof.ec` proofs of functional correctness of `bn_breduce`, `mulm`, and `expm`.
* `Ring_ops_extract_ct.ec` constant-time extraction of `ring_ops.jazz`.
* `Ring_ops_proof_ct.ec` constant-time proof.
* `Ring_ops_spec.ec` abstract specification of properties of `mulm`, `expm`, and `bn_breduce`.


### `test`
* `ring_ops.s` binary produced by Jasmin from `ring_ops.jazz` 
* `ring_ops.c` C program for testing (must be linked with `ring_ops.s`) during the compilation.
